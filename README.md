# SEMap

Is a:
* A CYOA type of editor for Socratic conversations [Live Demo](http://semap.duckdns.org/)
* A simple bot that examines your beliefs [Live Demo](http://semap.duckdns.org/BeliefExplorer.html)

The included database will help you examing your beliefs. 

Are you ready for the challenge?

## Purpose

The bot can help in multiple ways:

1) Have people use it an examine their beliefs. I am hoping to lure people by asking questions that are both intriguing and tricky. Think of it as a sudoku but instead of fitting numbers to that need to meet certain rules the point of this is to be consistent. They can still lie to themselves but the bot will catch them and, maybe not immediately, but when they take a shower or they are about to sleep, their contradiction will come back to bother them. The app is not a person, so being wrong will be less of a shame, so it is expected that people will be more honest than with a know person. So when people hit a contradiction they can either resolve or remain feeling inconsistent, a thing that is quite worrisome (and this has been scientifically proven : ) )

2) Teaching the Socratic method by example. What usually happens, on the learning resources I have found, is that all you get is a dialog or two as an example, this is like learning how to play chess by just looking at one game, then if the opponent does anything different you are lost. This app helps you play against yourself, and explore other variations and see the results. Hence it helps learn how to solve many different situations. The questioning used in the "deep-held beliefs" can easily be used to question other topics.

3) As a reference or as a cheat sheet, imagine you dont come up with a good question, you can have a quick peek at the bot or the graph.

4) Any other thing I had not thought of, but that you think it could be fun/interesting :)

Once people use it, I hope that every time they hear a claim, it pops in their head the question of "how do I know that what this person is saying is true", or "why do you attribute this effect to that cause?" and even to actually ask the question, because the Socratic method is a non confrontational way of discussing things.

So yes I agree that people in like to like to themselves so this app I hope it's going to be like the basement in horror movie, you know it wont be pleasant but still you want to see what is down there :) Of course YMMV. If this was this way with 1% of the people that use it this would already be a success :)

As for whether it is going to be a crowd-sourced app, the app is (and will be) open source and anyone can take the code and modify it. For now I am showing it first to a small audience of people that are enthusiastic about using the Socratic method themselves. I am hoping to get people involved at many levels, from just getting some feedback, to getting suggestions for new questions/answers, and some people they might even want to edit the graph or even create a new one for a different topic :) 

The plan is to have no limits, to explore this idea of bringing the Socratic method to the people, have fun, see what happens and hopefully make this world a better place :)
