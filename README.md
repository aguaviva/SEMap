## Purpose

Debating on certain beliefs often leads to aggressive conversations where nobody changes their mind. The Socratic method is a non confrontational method that helps break through dogmatism and impart the gift of doubt. This often results in drops of confidence in the belief.

## The toolkit

This repo includes:

1) A simple bot that will ask you Socratic questions on your belief [Live Demo](http://semap.duckdns.org/BeliefExplorer.html)
2) A conversation editor, that shows the conversation as a graph. [Live Demo](http://semap.duckdns.org/)

## How to use it

The bot can help in multiple ways:

1) Have people use it an examine their own beliefs. 
2) Teaching the Socratic method much better. Coming up with interesting questions is tricky and like in a game of chess one must consider on the spot all the possible responses of the other player. Online resources just show a couple of examples but if the other part replies something different one is at a loss. This app like a good chess book shows you how to solve many variants of a same game
3) As a reference or as a cheat sheet to help you come up with a good question in case you run out of ideas.
4) Any other thing I had not thought of, but that you think it could be fun/interesting :)

The included database will help you examing your beliefs. 

## How you can help

 I am hoping to get people involved at many levels, 
 
 1) from just getting some feedback, 
 2) getting suggestions for new questions/answers
 3) allow people to edit the graph or even create a new one for a different topic 

The plan is to have no limits, to explore this idea of bringing the Socratic method to the people, have fun, see what happens and hopefully make this world a better place :)
